# Cozy Fruit Delivery Game 🍎🍌🍓

A small 2D top-down game prototype developed in Unity as a learning project.

The player moves around the map collecting fruits and delivering them to the correct characters before time runs out.  
A special pickup grants a temporary speed boost, encouraging faster movement and route planning.

This project was created to practice Unity 2D fundamentals through a complete, playable experience.
